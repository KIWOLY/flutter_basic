Welcome to my **Flutter Learning Repository**!
This is where I practice and explore the **basics of Flutter** — Google’s powerful framework for building beautiful, cross-platform mobile applications.



##  About This Repository

This repository contains the projects and exercises I’ve completed while learning Flutter fundamentals.
It focuses on understanding:

* Flutter project structure
* Widgets and layouts
* Navigation between screens
* Simple and attractive UI designs
* Handling user input and interactivity



##  What I’m Learning

Here’s a summary of the core Flutter concepts and widgets I’ve studied so far:

### Layout & Structure

* `Column` and `Row` for arranging widgets vertically and horizontally
* `Padding` and `Margin` for spacing and layout control
* `SizedBox` for fixed space or spacing between widgets
* `Container` for building custom boxes and areas in the UI
* `Stack` for placing widgets on top of each other

###  UI & Design

* Adding and displaying **Images**
* Using **Icons** in the interface
* Styling text and widgets with `TextStyle` and colors

###  Navigation

* Moving between screens using `Navigator.push()`
* Returning to previous screens using `Navigator.pop()`
* Implementing **Drawer** and **ListTile** for navigation menus
