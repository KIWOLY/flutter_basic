# Flutter Basics Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Flutter Learning Repository**!
This is where I practice and explore the **basics of Flutter** — Google’s powerful framework for building beautiful, cross-platform mobile applications.



## About This Repository

This repository contains the projects and exercises I’ve completed while learning Flutter fundamentals.
It focuses on understanding:

* Flutter project structure
* Widgets and layouts
* Navigation between screens
* Simple and attractive UI designs
* Handling user input and interactivity



## What I’m Learning

Here’s a summary of the core Flutter concepts and widgets I’ve studied so far:

### Layout & Structure

* `Column` and `Row` — arrange widgets vertically and horizontally
* `Padding` and `Margin` — control spacing and layout
* `SizedBox` — create fixed space or spacing between widgets
* `Container` — build custom boxes and layout areas
* `Stack` — place widgets on top of each other
* `Wrap` — automatically arrange widgets when they run out of space
* `SafeArea` — avoid overlaps with system UI like notches or status bars



### UI & Design

* Adding and displaying **Images**
* Using **Icons** to enhance interfaces
* Styling text and widgets with `TextStyle` and colors
* Understanding **Theme** — applying consistent colors, fonts, and design
* Using **MaterialApp** — defining app structure, design, and navigation behavior
* Working with **Scaffold** — the main layout structure for each screen
* Exploring **AppBar Actions** and interactive **Icons**
* Controlling back navigation with `automaticallyImplyLeading`
* Designing list-style layouts using **ListTile**
* **FloatingActionButton** — for quick primary actions
* **BottomNavigationBar** — for navigating between main sections
* **Drawer** — for side navigation menus



### Navigation

* Moving between screens using `Navigator.push()`
* Returning to previous screens using `Navigator.pop()`
* Implementing **Drawer** and **ListTile** for navigation menus



### Flutter Widget Concepts

* Understanding **ListTile** — for creating structured list items with icons, titles, and subtitles

* Learning the difference between **StatelessWidget** and **StatefulWidget**

  * `StatelessWidget`: UI that does **not** change dynamically
  * `StatefulWidget`: UI that **updates or reacts** to user interaction

* Understanding **Null Safety** — avoiding runtime null errors with Dart’s type system



## Tools & Setup

* **Editor:** Visual Studio Code
* **Framework:** Flutter
* **Language:** Dart
* **Device:** Physical mobile phone (used as emulator/simulator)
